# HTCondor tests and demos

The only demo that currently exists in the repo is a docker demo. The docker
demo can be executed by navigating to the submission directory and running
`condor_submit docker.sub`. More about htcondor's docker implementation can be
found [here](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/docker-universe-applications.html)
